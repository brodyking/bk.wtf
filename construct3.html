            I recently got Construct 3 for one month. I have held off on the purchase just because of how expensive it is.
            It is $16 a month and $99 a year. That is dumb asf. It should just be a one time purchase of like $20.
            But I choked up the money and bought it...

            I like the new construct. I looks alot nicer and runs faster.<br />
            
            I want to create a multiplayer game. But that stuff is very hard. But I wanna try.
            I wont give up. I'm going to look through the manual and figure it out!
            It is easy to say that but I really want to try.

            I am tired of spending weeks making a game only for all my freinds to say, "well if it dosent have multiplayer, it isnt worth playing"
            Ill keep this page posted for more updates. But for now, that is all!
