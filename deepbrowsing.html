            Do you ever browse on random websites for like 10 minutes on end.<br />
            
            Just click links and browsing. Well that keeps happening to me.<br />
            
            I was on <a href="https://windows96.net">windows96.net</a> just clicking random links, and I was clicking links, going through many different pages.<br />
            
            When I was done i looked in my browser history and realized that i had just hopped through 9 different domains.<br />

            I never realized I did this that much.<br />
            
            I mean it is 1:39 AM right now and I am sitting here on a VIM editor just thinking to myself. How did I get here?<br />
            
            I dont know if any of this will make sense tmr when I log back on and see this pulled up but if you are reading it, I probobly didnt even think a second thought of it.
